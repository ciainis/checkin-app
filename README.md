.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .babelrc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`package-lock.json`** This is an automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

6.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

7.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
